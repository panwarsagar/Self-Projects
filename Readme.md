# Project Outline
This is an independent project started by me roughly a year ago to use artificial intelligence to recognize threat object - weapons and alert the law enforement units.

# What this application does?
This application recognizes the weapons (in this case the ML model has been trained to recognize a calculator) on the streets and alert the law enforcement units and other external users like security officers of the prominent buildings. The applications tarts by analyzing a live video feed and if a a threat object is detected then a map showing the SAFE, THREAT and DANGER zones pops up and a message is sent to the law enforcement unit.
This application involves a second part which is a mobile application written in JAVA to navigate a law enforcement unit to the location where the object has been detected.
